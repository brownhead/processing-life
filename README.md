Processing-Life
===============

An experiment with Processing.js.

The screen is divided into a large grid on which Conway's Game of Life is implemented. There's a little tweak to the rules however: the closer a cell is to your mouse the more quickly it experiences time. There's also some nice fading and coloring effects that make this thing look pretty.

What's the Point?
-----------------

I made it because I wanted to make something artsy. The original concept was much different and was based on [this website](http://carlosbergen.com/).
